# AO_Erosion_Simulator
Atomic-oxygen erosion simulator for LEO spacecraft surfaces. Couples molecular dynamics-derived local erosion data with a level-set PDE and a statistical, poly-Gaussian multi-reflection flux model to predict long-term surface morphology and global erosion yield evolution under hyper-thermal flow conditions.
